A little python script to cycle frames into Discord Rich Presence

Python 2.7 or newer will be needed to execute the script

This script uses EasyRP (Custom Discord Rich Presence) https://github.com/Pizzabelly/EasyRP

1. First you need to have already set up a discord application, for any info use link above
2. In your application page copy your CLIENT ID
3. Open DiscordUpdater.py with a text editor and paste it at line 77
